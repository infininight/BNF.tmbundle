# BNF.tmbundle

This bundle adds support for [Backus-Naur Form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backusâ€“Naur_Form) syntax grammars. It also adds a few handy snippets for writing out syntax rules.

BNF serves as a formal specification of a language's syntax that tools such as [CoreParse][] can use to construct parsers.
